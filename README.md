# CodeWars Challenge Solutions

- Here I have compiled many problems that I have solved on codewars.
- All are JS files.

## What These Teach Me ##
- Each time I try a new challenge, I am able to practice pseudo-coding skills as well as breaking down a problem into simple, organized steps.
- I also get practice doing isolated research whenever I get stuck at a part.
- They help me drill certain concepts since I need to implement similar lines of code for many solutions.
- I get a chance to not only see best practices, but also more creative or interesting ways of writing code, exposing me to different styles and sometimes much simpler solutions.
